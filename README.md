# JobFinderClient
This project is a job finder application where users can search for job opportunities through a client-server interaction. The client-side of the application is built using JavaFX, which provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with. The client communicates with the server through TCP/IP sockets, allowing for efficient request and response handling.
